              The Kids' Bedroom opens before {name}, revealing a scene of
              poignant abandonment. Once vibrant and lively, the room is now a
              ghostly reflection of its past. A small, ornate bed with a frayed,
              dusty canopy sits against the wall, surrounded by faded wallpaper
              with childish patterns. {name} notices old toys scattered across
              the floor, each covered in a thick layer of dust. A small, cracked
              window lets in only a sliver of light, casting long, eerie
              shadows. In one corner, an old rocking chair, worn and creaky,
              stands silently. As {name} surveys the room, a faint feeling of
              anticipation grows, as if something important lies hidden beneath
              the surface of this seemingly forgotten space, waiting to be
              discovered amidst the silent remnants of a lost childhood.

              box, dust-covered and aged, reveals a tarnished brass key with
              intricate designs when opened. The key feels weighty and
              significant, as if it holds the promise of unlocking something
              crucial. The discovery of this key suggests that there is an
              important mechanism or door elsewhere in the mansion that it might
              open, pushing {name} to explore further and delve deeper into the
              mansion's secrets.{" "}
